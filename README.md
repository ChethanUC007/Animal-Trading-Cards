# [Dragon Trading Cards](https://chethanuc007.github.io/Animal-Trading-Cards/)

[Seashocker Trading Card Website](https://chethanuc007.github.io/Animal-Trading-Cards/) is built using HTML and CSS.

## Project Info

* Created ​a ​trading ​card ​for Seashocker, a dragon. Used HTML ​to ​create ​the ​structure ​for ​your ​trading ​card and styled with ​CSS.

* This [project](https://chethanuc007.github.io/Animal-Trading-Cards/) combines the skills you mastered in the problem set and asks you to re-create a webpage from a design prototype.

* This is a common workflow for front-end web developers.

* Typically, you'll be provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website.

* In most cases, designers only provide you with the design prototype.

* he design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film.
* Created the card and swapping out the Seashocker.

    * Uses border around animal’s information.
    * Uses spacing between animal’s name, image, and information.
    * Card width should be fixed and include the spacing around the image (Since image is 300px wide, card should be 300px + spacing on either side. Card should not expand with the browser window).
